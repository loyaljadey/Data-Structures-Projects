# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: Figuring out a systematic way of placing the points of which to start each hexagon.

-----

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: The hexagon is uniform whilst the room just simply has to be connected and closed.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I would write a make room and hallway helper method. That I can generate rooms and hallways at certain points. Those points can be chosen at random. 

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: Hallway is long and narrow while a room is more evenly wide and long.
